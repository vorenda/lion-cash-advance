    "content": "Residents of Boca Raton are protected by Florida's comprehensive payday lending regulations, administered by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation's Division of Consumer Finance.\n\nFlorida law caps single-payment payday loans at $500 with a maximum fee of 10% of the loan amount, plus a $5 verification fee. For a $500 loan, you would pay no more than $55 in fees. For installment payday loans, the maximum is $1,000 with fees capped at 8% of the outstanding balance on a biweekly basis. All lenders must comply with federal Truth-in-Lending Act disclosure requirements.\n\nOne of Florida's most important protections is the 'one loan at a time' rule. You cannot have more than one payday loan outstanding anywhere in Florida, and you must wait 24 hours after paying off one loan before taking out another. This is enforced through a mandatory statewide database. Loan rollovers and extensions are strictly prohibited.",
