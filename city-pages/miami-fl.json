  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Where is your Miami cash advance location?",
      "answer": "Our Miami branch is located at 1247 Wynwood Avenue, Suite 150, right across from the famous Wynwood Walls in the Arts District. We're just off I-95 Exit 16, making us easy to access from anywhere in Miami-Dade County."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are your hours at the Miami location?",
      "answer": "We're open Monday through Friday from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and Saturday 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. We're closed on Sundays. Walk-ins are welcome, though you can also apply online to speed up the process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I have multiple cash advance loans in Miami?",
      "answer": "No. Florida law allows you to have only ONE payday loan outstanding at any time. All lenders must check the statewide Deferred Presentment Transaction System database before issuing a loan to ensure you don't already have another loan active. This protects you from debt traps."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the maximum cash advance in Miami?",
      "answer": "For single-payment loans, the maximum is $500 plus fees (max 10% plus $5 verification fee). For installment loans, you can borrow up to $1,000 with fees capped at 8% of the outstanding balance on a biweekly basis. These limits are set by Florida law."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I can't repay my Miami cash advance on time?",
      "answer": "Florida law provides important protections. If you inform your lender IN PERSON before the due date, you're entitled to a 60-day grace period at NO additional cost. You must complete credit counseling within that period. We'll provide you with a list of approved nonprofit agencies."
